Horton gets up at 7 AM every morning. He has cereal and toast for breakfast. He grabs his coat and hat and heads out the door. Today was different though. Today it was raining. Horton pulled the keys back out of his pocket and went back inside. Horton came back out with his umbrella, and his day continued, happier than before.
